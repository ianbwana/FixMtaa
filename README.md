## Fix Mtaa 

Is a project to help people use twitter for reporting common societal  problems such as floods,blackouts,potholes and broken street lights to the appropriate authority.Users locate problems and tweet  using a combination of hashtags without worrying about the correct authority to report it to.fixMtaa then works out the correct authority using the problem location and type and sends a report, by email or using sms.

This project was originally built in April 2016 as part of Nairobi Tech Week hackathon, powered by Twitter and AngelHack witha theme of SmartCityNairobi.

Original authors are Nigel Nindo(@nigelnindo), Hungai Kevin(@hungaikev) and Ian Bwana (@ianbwana). A powerpoint file is attached to te presentation explaining how the technology works.
